•  What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
Ans: It is a text file in your repository which has files or folders that the git doesn't track and upload to remote repository. For a java project,
it should include following files - class, log, jar, ctxt, mtj.tmp, war, nar, ear, and other java specific files.

•  What does fast-forward in git mean?
Ans: when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward 
because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a “fast-forward.” (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)

•  Why should you have different branches? 
Ans: In a team , multiple developers try to change the same source code to incorporate their changes. To isolate each developer's work and to have multiple versions of
same source code, we need different branches.  

•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
Ans: It depends on the size and scope of the project. If it is a smaller project where entire codebase is in one language and all features can be established together,
one repository is sufficient.
If it has multiple components (front-end done in React and backend in Django), multiple repositories are required to run, test and deploy them separately.
